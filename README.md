## Notes
1. This code will not work without a compatible PostgreSQL database.
2. This code will not grant you access to the bot's Warframe Market profile.
3. Any tokens you see in the config file are fictional and do not relate to anything about the bot. Nice try but not today.
4. No i will not provide a database map, as i do not have one.
5. Run this bot at your own risk, i do not have the time or energy available to make it run without the database, so you are welcome to modify it

## THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH NO LICENSE, YOU ARE FREE TO USE IT HOW YOU CHOOSE. WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION THAT YOU MUST HAVE AT LEAST 1 REFERENCE SOMEWHERE USER FACING THAT YOU DID NOT PRODUCE THE BASE OF THE BOT, AND THAT IT WAS CREATED BY MYSELF.
